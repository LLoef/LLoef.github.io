Gordon Cooper (American aeronautical engineer, test pilot and one of the seven original astronauts in Project Mercury, the first manned space program of the United States) held claim until his death that the U.S. government is indeed covering up information about UFOs.  This was one of his last quotes.

 
>For many years I have lied with a secret.  In a secrecy imposed on all specialists in astronautics.  I can now reveal that everyday, in the U.S.A.  Our radar instruments capture objects of form and composition - unknown to us.
